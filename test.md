# Hello!

I'm Joe. I'm 45 and I'm a nerd. I've been around; I've been a professional software developer, a nightclub DJ, a chef, and run a couple of businesses with my very lovely wife.  

I've been coding for over 30 years (C++,VB,Asp,.NET,C#,Oracle,Sql Server,Python). I'm currently learning data science, machine learning, deep learning etc and I'm currently focussed on [fast.ai](http://fast.ai). This is what I want to do until I retire. 

I live in Surrey (UK).

I am not actively applying for positions just yet, as I'm concentrating my time on finishing the fast.ai course but I'm open to conversation. If you wish to discuss a job in the London/Surrey area (or a remote working job), I'd be happy to hear from you.
